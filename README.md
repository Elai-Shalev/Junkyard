## About The Project

Junkyard is a vintage seeker's social media app and marketplace. On Junkyard "junkies" can find hand-me down furniture, books, clothes and more all in their local area. "Dumpers" can dispose of their once-loved items and upload their whereabouts to the world. One man's trash is another one's treasure, right?

## Flow of Usage

The user can use the integrated map to locate once-loved items (junk) in any area they wish to search. Upon selecting an item, a short description of the ite will be displayed.
The user can also upload new items to the system, choosin to take a photo with the built-in camera function or by selecting from the camera roll. They will be propted to include some attributed of the item, a short description, and an estimation of it's state.

## Architecture

Junkyard features a front-end app written in Swift, while having it's server run on NodeJS. It implements a camera feature, GPS, and connects to a database hosted on MongoDB.
